WebTemplates
============

WebTemplates is the compilation of many website different website templates that I have made. 

Anyone can come and use these templates, but just a few things I would like you to do:

- Give me credit for making the templates.
- Provide a link to this repository in the template.
- Follow me on Github? (LOL)

You dont NEED to do those things but it would be nice if you do so. Thank you.
