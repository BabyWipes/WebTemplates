WebTemplates
============

WebTemplates is the compilation of many website different website templates that I have made. 

Anyone can come and use these templates, but just a few things I would like you to do:

- Give me credit for making the templates.
- Provide a link to this repository in the template.
- Follow me on Github? 

You dont NEED to do those things but it would be nice if you do so. Thank you.

If you wish to contribute your own templates, email me at jboparai1999@hotmail.com or contact me on skype, jaskirat.master, thanks. Make sure your details are included in the template code, made as a comment at the end of each html file, after the <html>, thanks.

You cannot make changes to a template unless it is a fix or if it is with the creators permission.
